          What is a stock market index?
        </p>
        <p>
         A stock index, or stock market index, is an index that measures a stock market, or a subset of the stock market, that helps investors compare current price levels with past prices to calculate market performance.
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
          Examples of stock market index:
        </p>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>NASDAQ Composite</li>
            <li>Dow Jones Industrial Average</li>
            <li>S&P 500 Index</li>
            <li>BSE SENSEX</li>
            <li>NIFTY 50</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
          What is a Stock market?
        </p>
        <p>
         A stock market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms.
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
          Example of Indian Stocks:
        </p>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Reliance Industries Limited</li>
            <li>State Bank of India</li>
            <li>Yes Bank</li>
            <li>Hindustan Unilever</li>
            <li>DHFL</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
          Argumentative Visualization:
        </p>
        <p>
          To show how data can be misleading and argumentative, I have took the stock market price of an Indian company DHFL as an example.
          <br/>
          <li>
            <span style="color:blue;">Left chart: </span>If I take data from the past few months (from Oct 14 to today), it has been increased from 13.25 INR to 31.25 INR, which shows that there are high profits with investing in this company.
            <br />
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Rhetoric device => Anchoring</li>
                <li>Rhetoric Method => Omission and Scaling</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
           <span style="color:blue;">Right chart: </span> But, when I consider the data of past 36 months (from Dec 2017 to today), I can see the share price of the same company fell from 600.65 INR to 31.25 INR, which shows that the earlier profits claimed in other visualization is misleading the investors.
           <br />
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Rhetoric device => Anchoring</li>
                <li>Rhetoric Method => Omission and Scaling</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          I am inspired with this topic as this is one of the very common domain where companies try to show that they are in profits from a long time
          </li>
        </p>
